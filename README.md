- Edit Tasks: Users can modify any task using the edit option.

- Mark as Completed: Users can check off completed tasks.
- Task Persistence: The list of tasks and user name is saved in the browser's localStorage, ensuring data persists across page reloads.
- Track Progress: The app displays the total number of tasks and the number of completed tasks.
- Name Storage: The app prompts the user to input their first name, which is also saved in localStorage.
